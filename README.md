# Description
The repository provides the code for synthetic sketch generation and the evaluated deep models.

# Synthetic sketch generation
## 1. Conver to manifold shapes
Since many shapes in the publicly available datasets are not manifold shapes, we first recommend preprocessign shapes with this method:

## 2. Extract curve networks
To extract the curve netwrok we the auhtors implementation of this paper:

## 3. Synhteic sketch generation

# Deep models
